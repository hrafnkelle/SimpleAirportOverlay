# SimpleAirportOverlay
Finds the closest airport when flying in MSFS and makes avaible for using in OBS overlays

The program assumes you have Little Navmap installed and have already used it to index your MSFS installation.
The program uses its database to create a spatial index of airports so they can be looked up by proximity
